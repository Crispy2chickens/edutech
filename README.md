This is a full-stack application, which allows users to upload a drone image. Our YOLO-v11 CNN model will detect if there is any trash in the image, and if so, the number of trash. The coordinates of the drone image will be extracted, and the image will be displayed as a point on our Google Maps API. Over time, as we upload more images, a trash density heatmap can be produced. 

The prototype earned our team champion at the Edutech Asia 2024 Planet Protectors. We also gave a keynote on this solution in front of 1000 people.
